These are a set of plugins for Vim.  You can download released versions here:

  lusty-explorer.vim: http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1890
  lusty-juggler.vim:  http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2050

(These are certainly well tested, but they can be quite old.  You're probably
fine to use current HEAD of this repository.)

Installation:

- Copy the the plugin/ and autoload/ directories to your ~/.vim.

Submitting a patch:

- autoload/lustyexplorer.vim and autoload/lustyjuggler.vim are generated
  files; modify src/ as well if you'd like to submit a patch.

- To test your changes for regressions:

  $ cd tests/
  $ VIM=/path/to/vim ./run-tests.bash


Note: the Emacs version of this plugin used to be here, too, but now it has
its own repository:
